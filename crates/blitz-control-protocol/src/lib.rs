//! Typed local debugging protocol carried by endpoint-libs framing.
//!
//! This is deliberately not WebDriver. It models the native renderer and app
//! lifecycle directly, supports observation by more than one client, and has
//! no authentication handshake. Agent control binds only to a local transport;
//! expensive diagnostics collection remains an explicit compile-time feature
//! *of the server*, `tauri-runtime-blitz/diagnostics`.
//!
//! # Why this is its own crate
//!
//! These are the server's own definitions, and a client that hand-rolls the
//! JSON gets them wrong in ways that do not look like encoding mistakes.
//! `AgentAction` is adjacently tagged, so `{"action":"click","node_id":9}` is
//! malformed where `{"action":"click","params":{"node_id":9}}` is correct, and
//! the difference used to present as a hung application. Sharing the types
//! makes that a compile error.
//!
//! Speaking the protocol must not cost a renderer. `tauri-runtime-blitz` pulls
//! in tauri, winit, wgpu and blitz, so a measurement tool that depended on it
//! for these types would build a browser engine to send a wheel event. Nothing
//! here needs any of that: it is serde plus endpoint-libs' framing.
//!
//! # No `diagnostics` feature, on purpose
//!
//! The types are inert data definitions and cost nothing to compile, whereas
//! gating them creates feature skew: cargo unifies features across a build, so
//! one workspace member asking for diagnostics types while the server crate is
//! built without them turned `DebugResponse` into a non-exhaustive match in
//! code nobody had touched. What stays gated in the server is *collection*,
//! which is where the expense actually is. A build that cannot serve
//! diagnostics says so by omitting the tool from `tools/list`; see
//! [`encode_tools_list_response`].
